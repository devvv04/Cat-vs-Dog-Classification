# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classification (NumPy CNN from Scratch)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** from scratch using **NumPy only**, without TensorFlow, Keras, or any other deep learning framework.  
It classifies images into two categories: **Cat** or **Dog**.

The purpose of this project is to understand and build the core components of a CNN manually — convolution layers, pooling layers, activation functions, and fully connected layers — while handling image preprocessing and training logic.

## 🚀 Features
- CNN implemented entirely in **NumPy**
- Custom image preprocessing and normalization
- Forward & backward propagation from scratch
- Training loop with loss calculation
- Accuracy tracking during training
- Model testing on unseen images

- **Classes:** 2 (`Cat`, `Dog`)
- **Image Size:** Resized to **64×64** for computational efficiency
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Converted to RGB arrays
  - Normalized pixel values between 0 and 1
  - Shuffled and split into **training** and **testing** sets
